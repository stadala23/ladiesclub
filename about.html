    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Srihari — a full-stack developer and machine learning enthusiast from India, currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science at Portland State University. I’m passionate about building scalable systems, solving real-world problems through code, and exploring the power of Large Language Models.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my internship, I worked on a collaborative project where we built a GitHub bot to manage stale issues. The bot could identify outdated tasks, sort them by relevance, and suggest new ones based on each contributor’s history. As a team, we followed Agile practices with tools like Jenkins (CI), Selenium (testing), and Ansible (automation).
    </p>
    <p>
        At Portland State, I’ve gained hands-on experience designing scalable web applications and research systems. I spearheaded the development of an event registration platform that supported over 3,000 users, optimizing both frontend and backend performance to handle high traffic efficiently. Additionally, I’ve worked on a multi-agent research platform integrating technologies like LangGraph, RAG, and FastAPI, focusing on automating document processing and intelligent information retrieval. I’m highly comfortable working with backend technologies, including Flask, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, and have built robust pipelines for storing, querying, and managing large-scale datasets using SQL and cloud services like AWS S3 and GCP.

    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of academic projects, I’ve built full-stack applications like MediConnect, a healthcare e-commerce app that includes a chatbot and real-time health data. I’m also comfortable working on production-grade systems using React, Flask, and PostgreSQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like many engineers, my journey hasn't been linear. There were moments of doubt, but those challenges taught me resilience. I believe setbacks are stepping stones that help us grow — both personally and professionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I continue exploring this ever-evolving field, I bring curiosity, adaptability, and a drive to keep building things that matter.
